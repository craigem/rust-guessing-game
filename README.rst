Rust Guessing Game
==================

The Rust guesiing game from the rust-docs book.

It implements a classic beginner programming problem: the guessing game. Here’s
how it works: Our program will generate a random integer between one and a
hundred.  It will then prompt us to enter a guess. Upon entering our guess, it
will tell us if we’re too low or too high. Once we guess correctly, it will
congratulate us.
